# Swear-Jar
Mobile curse word detector that motivates users to cut back on swearing.

Swear Jar is a mobile application that listens to your everyday speech and logs whenever you use a designated swear word. Upon hearing this word, the application communicates with our web app and registers the swear in the database. For each time the user swears, 50 cents is donated from their Venmo account to the charity Give Directly which strives to help impoverished families in both Kenya and Uganda. In addition, users are able to view their stats for the day and compete against friends to see who swears the least.
